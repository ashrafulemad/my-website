<b> ACTIVITIES OF OUR CLUB:</b></br>
MBSTUSC is one of 5the most important clubs of our UNIVERSITY.At the very beginning of our club it was named MSS(MBSTU SCIENCE SOCIETY). But 
in the very last days of the year 2019 it has changed its name. And the club is named then MBSTUSC (MBSTU SCIENCE CLUB). Here we are conjucted with almost all the science related subjects of our UNIVERSITY.
We had taken many kinds of compititions and events in our university yet. We have also some plans now on national basis.</br>
 We generally celebrate the scientific days of the year which are very important. We had a great ivent on the INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE DAY also.</br>
 Actually it is a better forum for the students to realize the science aspirations and fulfil their interest in pursuing activities for which they do not 
 get oppurtunities within the syllabus framework!!!</br>
